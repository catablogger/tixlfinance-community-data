## About Polkadot

Polkadot is an open-source blockchain network designed to connect multiple blockchains into one unified network. The multichain protocol allows cross-chain exchange and tranfger of data and assets between sub-chains called parachains. Each chain is built using Parity Substrate modular framework which allows developers to use different components that are suitable to their chain needs.

The infrastructure of Polkadot is constitued by the Relay Chain which is the central chain of the network, the parachains that are all the parallel chains connected to the Relay Chain, and the bridges that allows parachains to connect and community with external networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Polkadot founder is Gavin Wood, who is one of the co-founder of Ethereum and the inventor of the Solidity smart contract language and is been working on it since 2016.
