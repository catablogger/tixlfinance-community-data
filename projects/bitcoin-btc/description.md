## About Bitcoin

Bitcoin was created in January 2009 following the housing market crash which caused a global financial crisis. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash that aims to be a means of exchange and store of value that is independent of any central authority, unlike government-issued currencies.
