## About Cardano

Cardano is a open-source Proof-of-Stake blockchain platform that is being built and designed since 2015. Cardano relies heavily on academic research and is supported by three organizations: The Cardano Foundation, IOHK and Emurgo which provides development, funding, research and promotion.

Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and the current CEO of IOHK.

The Proof-of-Stake blockchain network was uniquely designed with different components such as multi-asset support, verifiable smart contracts, and dApp development platform. The platform is composed by two layers, the settlement layer which is responsible for the value of the transactions (currency) and the computation layer which is the smart contract layer.
