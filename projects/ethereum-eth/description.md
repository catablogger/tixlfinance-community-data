## About Ethereum

Ethereum is considered the world's programmable blockchain. It is the first blockchain popularizing smart contracts and it's now the most used platform, with thousands of users and dApps (decentralized applications). The native token of the Ethereum network is Eth, which works as a medium of exchange, payment for transactions fees (gas) and as collateral for borrowing different ERC-20 assets in the DeFi (Decentralzied Finance) ecosystem.

Unlike bitcoin in which the creator who is known as Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The founding team of Ethereum are known individuals which includes Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di lorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilke. Not all the founding members are still with the Ethereum Foundation, as some has moved on to work on other projects.

Ethereum is on the path to upgrade to Eth 2.0 which will make it more scalable, secure, and more sustainable.
